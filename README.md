# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project contains code and resources for predicting Microsoft stock prices using TensorFlow and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## DataSet 

The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDHtyrUTQoVr877zNBrGhSOZCsvV5BlY/view) used for training and testing the model is historical Microsoft stock price data. The dataset should be provided as a CSV file, containing the following columns:

* Date: The date of the stock price record.

* Open: The opening price of the stock on that day.

* High: The highest price of the stock on that day.

* Low: The lowest price of the stock on that day.

* Close: The closing price of the stock on that day.

* Volume: The trading volume of the stock on that day.

## Tech Used 
 
* Python

* TensorFlow

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

## Result

After running the code, the predicted Microsoft stock prices for the test set and a visualization of the predicted prices compared to the actual prices is obtained.

## Future Aspects
With the help of LSTM Model a web app will be made using Streamlit framework which will show live prediction of stocks of Microsoft.

## Acknowledgments

* The code in this repository is based on the concepts and techniques from the field of deep learning and time series analysis.
